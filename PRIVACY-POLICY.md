# fuchsia Privacy Policy
Last revision and effective date: 10 July, 2021

## Data Collected
### Data You Provide (For Individuals)
- **Your Discord user ID**  
  In profile creation, fuchsia links your Discord user ID to your profile attributes.
- **User Settings**  
  Any settings you change will be stored for the purpose of persistence.
- **Profile**  
  Upon creating a profile, the current time will be saved as your profile creation timestamp. Also note that you can customize a timezone on your profile, which is completely optional, and serves only to enrich usage.  

### Data You Provide (For Server Managers)
- **Your server ID**  
  In server configuration creation, fuchsia links your server ID to your server's attributes.
- **Server Settings**  
  Any settings you change will be stored for the purpose of persistence.
- **Starboard Data**  
  The message, channel, and server IDs of messages that are sent to a server's "Starboard" will be stored for the purpose of persistence.

### Ephemeral Data
The "Highlight" feature of fuchsia works by notifying users when certain phrases/words are used in a message. In order to notify a user, the content and author of a few (7 maximum) surrounding messages. The lifespan of this data is in the realm of seconds, and none of it is stored.

## How Data Is Collected
Data collection is done on an as-requested basis. Any user or server who has not explicitly created a profile/configuration ("opted in") will have none of their data stored. Until opting in, certain functionality may be unavailable.

Note that by creating a server configuration, a server manager implicitly opts all members of that server into the collection of starboard data.

## Usage of Data
- Enable you to customize fuchsia's functionality
- Allow your options to persist for extended periods of time
- Certain data may be displayed publicly

Your profile creation timestamp will always be available publicly. Circumstantially (depending on if you have customized the feature), your timezone will be displayed publicly on your profile as well. If you have not set, or have reset your timezone, it will **not** be displayed.

## Communication with You
fuchsia will not contact you directly without explicitly being permitted to do so. By making use of the "Highlight" feature, you allow fuchsia to send you Direct Messages containing the content of the "trigger message" and its surrounding context.

## Your Data Retention
Your data belongs to you, and will be treated as such. Both individual profiles, and server configurations ("the entity"), may be deleted at any time. This deletes the entity, as well as **all** data associated with that entity.

## Future Changes to this Policy
This Privacy Policy may be revised or updated in the future. Any such changes will be announced in advance of their effective date.
